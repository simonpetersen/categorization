 under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act starting in 2014 Source CRS

On July 14 2009 House Democratic leaders introduced a 1017page plan for overhauling the US health care system which Obama wanted Congress to approve by the end of 2009 After much public debate during the Congressional summer recess of 2009 Obama delivered a speech to a joint session of Congress on September 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals In March 2009 Obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research

On November 7 2009 a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the House On December 24 2009 the Senate passed its own billwithout a public optionon a partyline vote of 6039 On March 21 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA passed by the Senate in December was passed in the House by a vote of 219 to 212 Obama signed the bill into law on March 23 2010

The ACA includes healthrelated provisions most of which took effect in 2014 including expanding Medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133of the federal poverty level FPL starting in 2014 subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400of the FPL 88000 for family of four in 2010 so their maximum outofpocket payment for annual premiums will be from 2 to 95 of income providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on preexisting conditions establishing health insurance exchanges prohibiting annual coverage caps and support for medical research According to White House and CBO figures the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level



The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes fees and costsaving measures such as new Medicare taxes for those in highincome brackets taxes on indoor tanning cuts to the Medicare Advantage program in favor of traditional Medicare and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons In March 2010 the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by 143billion over the first decade

The law faced several legal challenges primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional On June 28 2012 the Supreme Court ruled by a 54 vote in National Federation of Independent Business v Sebelius that the mandate was constitutional under the US Congress's taxing authority In Burwell v Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that closelyheld forprofit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act from regulations adopted under the ACA that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives In June 2015 the Court ruled 63 in King v Burwell that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges not only those purchasing plans established by the State as the statute reads
