Showrunner David Benioff jokingly suggested The Sopranos in Middleearth as Game of Thrones tagline referring to its intriguefilled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons In a 2012 study of deaths per episode it ranked second out of 40 recent US TV drama series with an average of 14

Themes

The series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism George RR Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles political intrigue and the characters believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre Martin has stated that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords but from ourselves Just like people's capacity for good and for evil in real life Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change The series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective unlike in many other fantasies and thus the supposed villains can provide their side of the story Benioff said George brought a measure of harsh realism to high fantasy He introduced gray tones into a blackandwhite universe In later seasons critics pointed out that certain characters had developed plot armor to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to Game of Thrones deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series

Inspirations and derivations
Although the first season closely follows the events of the first novel later seasons have made significant changes According to David Benioff the series is about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones but not necessarily each of the stops along the way

The novels and their adaptations base aspects of their settings characters and plot on events in European history Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval Europe from lands and cultures to the palace intrigue feudal system castles and knightly tournaments A principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses 145585 between the houses of Lancaster and York reflected in Martin's houses of Lannister and Stark The scheming Cersei Lannister evokes Isabella the shewolf of France 12951358

Holland further proposes that other historical antecedents of series elements include Hadrian's Wall which becomes Martin's Wall the Roman Empire and the legend of Atlantis ancient Valyria Byzantine Greek fire wildfire Icelandic sagas of the Viking Age the Ironborn the Mongol hordes the Dothraki the Hundred Years' War and the Italian Renaissance

Cast and characters

 Tyrion Lannister has led the principal cast since the second season

Game of Thrones has an ensemble cast estimated to be the largest on television during its third season 257 cast names were recorded In 2014 several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventhseason option with raises which reportedly made them among the highestpaid performers on cable TV In 2016 several actor contracts were again renegotiated reportedly increasing the salary of five of the main cast members to 2 million per episode for the last two seasons which would make them the highest paid actors on television The main cast is listed below

Lord Eddard Ned Stark Sean Bean is the head of House Stark whose members are involved in plot lines throughout most of the series He and his wife Catelyn Tully Michelle Fairley have five children Robb Richard Madden the eldest followed by Sansa Sophie Turner Arya Maisie Williams Bran Isaac HempsteadWright and Rickon Art Parkinson the youngest Ned's illegitimate son Jon Snow Kit Harington and his friend Samwell Tarly John Bradley serve in the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont James Cosmo The Wildlings living north of the Wall include young Gilly Hannah Murray and warriors Tormund Giantsbane Kristofer Hivju and Ygritte Rose Leslie

Others associated with House Stark include Ned's ward Theon Greyjoy Alfie Allen his vassal Roose Bolton Michael McElhatton and Bolton's bastard son Ramsay Snow Iwan Rheon Robb falls in love with the healer Talisa Maegyr Oona Chaplin and Arya befriends the blacksmith's apprentice Gendry Joe Dempsie and the assassin Jaqen H'ghar Tom Wlaschiha The tall warrior Brienne of Tarth Gwendoline Christie serves Catelyn and later Sansa Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel A Game of Thrones shared his enthusiasm with D B Weiss and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series Weiss finished the first novel in maybe 36 hours They pitched the series to HBO after a fivehour meeting with Martin himself a veteran screenwriter in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard According to Benioff they won Martin over with their answer to his question Who is Jon Snow's mother I knew it couldn't be done as a network television series It's too adult The level of sex and violence would never have gone through

The series began development in January 2007 Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were later added to write one episode apiece the first season and June 2008 respectively Although HBO liked both drafts a pilot was not ordered until November 2008 the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike may have delayed the process

The pilot reportedly cost HBO 510 million to produce while the first season's budget was estimated at 5060 million In the second season the series received a 15percent budget increase for the climactic battle in Blackwater which had an 8 million budget Between 2012 and 2015 the average budget per episode increased from 6 million to at least 8 million The sixthseason budget was over 10 million per episode for a season total of over 100 million and a series record

Casting
Nina Gold and Robert Sterne are the series' primary casting directors Through a process of auditions and readings the main cast was assembled The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean whom the writers wanted from the start they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009 Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon Addy was according to showrunners Benioff and Weiss the easiest actor to cast for the series being that his audition was on point Some of the characters in the pilot were recast for the first season Catelyn Stark was initially played by Jennifer Ehle but the role was recast with Michelle Fairley Daenerys Targaryen was also recast with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant The rest of the first season's cast was filled in the second half of 2009

Although many of the cast returned after the first season the producers had many new characters to cast for each of the following seasons Due to the large number of new characters Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters in the second season and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters

Writing
 and wrote one episode for each of the first four seasons

Game of Thrones used seven writers in six seasons Series creators David Benioff and D B Weiss the showrunners write most of the episodes each season

A Song of Ice and Fire author George R R Martin wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel The Winds of Winter Jane Espenson cowrote one firstseason episode as a freelance writer

  A Clash of Kings and some early chapters from  The remaining onethird of A Storm of Swords and some elements from A Feast for Crows and  A Feast for Crows A Dance with Dragons and original content with some late chapters from A Storm of Swords and elements from  Original content and outline from The Winds of Winter and 

The first two seasons adapted one novel each For the later seasons its creators see Game of Thrones as an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels this enables them to move events across novels according to screenadaptation requirements

Visual effects
For the series' large number of visual effects HBO hired Britishbased BlueBolt and Irishbased Screen Scene for season one Most of the environment builds were done as 25D projections giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming In 2011 the seasonone finale Fire and Blood was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects Scenes were also produced by Britishbased Peanut FX Canadianbased Spin VFX and USbased Gradient Effects Valar Morghulis and Valar Dohaeris earned Pixomondo Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in 2012 and 2013 respectively The seasonfour finale The Children won the 2014 Emmy Award for Visual Effects Additional producers for season four included Canadianbased Rodeo FX Germanbased Scanline VFX and USbased BAKED FX The muscle and wing movements of the adolescent dragons in seasons four and five were based largely on those of a chicken Pixomondo retained a team of 22 to 30 people which focused solely on visualizing Daenerys Targaryen's dragons with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks For the fifth season HBO added Canadianbased Image Engine and USbased Crazy Horse Effects to its list of main visualeffects producers

Sound
Unusual for a television series the sound team receives a rough cut of a full season and approaches it as a tenhour feature film Although seasons one and two had different sound teams one team has been in charge of sound since then For the series' bloodandgore sounds the team often uses a chamois For dragon screams mating tortoises and dolphin seal lion and bird sounds have been used

Title sequence


The series' title sequence was created by production studio Elastic for HBO Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence which depicts a threedimensional map of the series' fictional world The map is projected on the inside of a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere As the camera moves across the map focusing on the locations of the episode's events clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map Accompanied by the title music the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writers and director Its composition changes as the story progresses with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all

Music

 composed the Game of Thrones score

The music for the series was composed by Ramin Djawadi The first season's soundtrack written in about ten weeks before the premiere was published by Varèse Sarabande in June 2011 Soundtrack albums for subsequent seasons have been released with tracks by the National the Hold Steady and Sigur Rós Djawadi has composed themes for each of the major houses and also for some of the main characters The themes may evolve over time as Daenerys Targaryen's theme started small and then became more powerful after each season Her theme started first with a single instrument a cello and Djawadi later incorporated more instruments for it Characters foreign to Westeros often have a nonBritish accent

Although the common language of Westeros is represented as English the producers charged linguist David J Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the novels Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English It has been reported that during the series these fictional languages have been heard by more people than the Welsh Irish and Scots Gaelic languages combined

Tourism organizations elsewhere reported increases in bookings after their locations appeared in Game of Thrones In 2012 bookings through LateRoomscom increased by 28 percent in Dubrovnik and 13 percent in Iceland The following year bookings doubled in Ouarzazate Morocco the location of Daenerys' seasonthree scenes Game of Thrones has been attributed as a significant factor in the boom of tourism in Iceland that had a strong impact on its economy Tourist numbers increased by 30 in 2015 followed by another 40 in 2016 with a final figure of 24 million visitors expected for 2016 which is around seven times the population of the country  However the increase in tourism to Dubrovnik with Game of Thrones estimated to be responsible for half of its annual increase over many years had led to concerns on overtourism and its mayor to impose limits on tourist number in the city

Copyright infringement
Game of Thrones has been widely pirated primarily outside the US Illegal downloads increased to about seven million in the first quarter of 2015 up 45 percent from 2014 An unnamed episode was downloaded about 4280000 times through public BitTorrent trackers in 2012 roughly equal to its number of broadcast viewers Piracy rates were particularly high in Australia and US Ambassador to Australia Jeff Bleich issued a statement condemning Australian piracy of the series in 2013

Delays in availability apart from HBO and its affiliates before 2015 and the cost of subscriptions to these services have been cited as causes of the series' illegal distribution According to TorrentFreak a subscription to a service for Game of Thrones would cost up to 25 per month in the United States up to 26 per episode in the UK and up to 52 per episode in Australia

For combating piracy HBO said in 2013 that it intended to make its content more widely available within a week of the US premiere including HBO Go In 2015 the fifth season was simulcast to 170 countries and to HBO Now users Within a day of the leak the files were downloaded over 800000 times in one week the illegal downloads reached 32million with the seasonfive premiere alone The Wars to Come pirated 13million times The seasonfive finale Mother's Mercy was the most simultaneously shared file in the history of the BitTorrent filesharing protocol with over 250000 simultaneous sharers and over 15million downloads in eight hours For the sixth season HBO did not send screeners to the press so as to prevent the spread of unlicensed copies and possible spoilers

Observers including series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said that illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects it benefited from buzz and social commentary and the high piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions According to Polygon HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premiumtelevision freetoplay model At a 2015 Oxford Union debate series cocreator David Benioff said that he was just glad that people watched the series illegally downloaded episodes sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy especially in countries where Game of Thrones was not televised Cocreator D B Weiss had mixed feelings saying that the series was expensive to produce and if it doesn't make the money back then it ceases to exist However he was pleased that so many people enjoy the show so much they can't wait to get their hands on it In 2015 Guinness World Records called Game of Thrones the most pirated television program

Reception and achievements
Game of Thrones was highly anticipated by fans before its premiere and has become a critical and commercial success According to The Guardian by 2014 it was the biggest drama and the most talked about show on television

Cultural influence
Although Game of Thrones was dismissed by some critics before it began Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics dragons and politics for example which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional toptier drama series With other fantasy series it has been cited for an increase in the purchase and abandonment of huskies and other wolflike dogs

Game of Thrones has added to the popular vocabulary The first season's scene in which Petyr Baelish explains his motives or background while prostitutes had sex in the background gave rise to the word sexposition for providing exposition with sex and nudity Dothraki the series' nomadic horsemen was ranked fourth in a September 2012 Global Language Monitor list of words from television most used on the Internet In 2012 the media used Game of Thrones as a figure of speech or comparison for situations of intense conflict and deceit such as the 2012 United States Supreme Court decision regarding healthcare reform legislation the Syrian Civil War and the ousting of Bo Xilai from the Chinese government

Khaleesi has increased in popularity as a name for baby girls in the United States In the novels and the TV series the word is a title meaning the wife of a Khal warlord in the Dothraki language held by   

Game of Thrones has received critical acclaim although the series' frequent use of nudity and violence has been criticized Its seasons have appeared on annual best of lists published by The Washington Post 2011 TIME 2011 and 2012 and The Hollywood Reporter 2012

The performances of the cast have received immense praise Peter Dinklage's charming morally ambiguous and selfaware Tyrion who earned him Emmy and Golden Globe awards was noted In many ways Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage wrote Mary McNamara of the LA Times before Tyrion became the series' central figure in season two Several critics highlighted performances by actresses Fourteenyearold Maisie Williams noted in the first season for her debut as Arya Stark was singled out for her seasontwo work with veteran actor Charles Dance Tywin Lannister Stephen Dillane has received positive reviews for his performance as Stannis Baratheon especially in the fifth season with one critic noting Whether you like Stannis or not you have to admit that Stephen Dillane delivered a monumental performance this season

The series has a rating of 97 percent on Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 84 out of 10 based on 44 reviews According to Variety There may be no show more profitable to its network than 'Game of Thrones' is to HBO Fully produced by the pay cabler and already a global phenomenon after only one season the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely The second season was also well received Entertainment Weekly praised its vivid vital and just plain fun storytelling and according to the Hollywood Reporter the series made a strong case for being one of TV's best series its seriousness made it the only drama comparable to Mad Men or Breaking Bad The New York Times gave the series a mixed review criticizing its number of characters their lack of complexity and a meandering plot

The third season was extremely well received by critics with Metacritic giving it a score of 91 out of 100 indicating universal acclaim George R R Martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature and that rape and sexual violence are common in war and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes its historical realism Charlie Anders wrote in io9 that while the first season was replete with lighthearted sexposition the second season appeared to focus on distasteful exploitative and dehumanizing sex with little informational content According to The Washington Posts Anna Holmes the nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men right down to the Brazilian waxes sported by the women in the series' fauxmedieval setting which made these scenes alienating to other viewers The Huffington Posts Maureen Ryan likewise noted that Game of Thrones mostly presented women naked rather than men and that the excess of random boobage undercut any aspirations the series might have to address the oppression of women in a feudal society Saturday Night Live parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed the series as retaining a thirteenyearold boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible

In the third season which saw Theon Greyjoy lengthily tortured and eventually emasculated the series was also criticized for its use of torture New York magazine called the scene torture porn Madeleine Davies of Jezebel agreed saying it's not uncommon that Game of Thrones gets accused of being torture pornsenseless objectifying violence combined with senseless objectifying sexual imagery According to Davies although the series' violence tended to serve a narrative purpose Theon's torture in The Bear and the Maiden Fair was excessive

A scene in the fourth season's episode Breaker of Chains in which Jaime Lannister rapes his sister and lover Cersei triggered a broad public discussion about the series' depiction of sexual violence against women According to Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times the scene caused outrage in part because of comments by director Alex Graves that the scene became consensual by the end Itzkoff also wrote that critics fear that rape has become so pervasive in the drama that it is almost background noise a routine and unshocking occurrence Sonia Saraiya of The AV Club wrote that the series' choice to portray this sexual act and a similar one between Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo in the first seasonboth described as consensual in the source novelsas a rape appeared to be an act of exploitation for shock value

In the fifth season's episode Unbowed Unbent Unbroken Sansa Stark is raped by Ramsay Bolton Most reviewers including those from Vanity Fair Salon The Atlantic and The Daily Beast found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary For example Joanna Robinson writing for Vanity Fair said that the scene undercuts all the agency that's been growing in Sansa since the end of last season In contrast Sara Stewart of The New York Post wondered why viewers were not similarly upset about the many background and minor characters who'd undergone similar or worse treatment In response to the scene pop culture website The Mary Sue announced that it would cease coverage of the series because of the repeated use of rape as a plot device and US Senator Claire McCaskill said that she would no longer watch it

As the sixth and seventh seasons saw Daenerys Sansa and Cersei assume ruling positions Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post noted that the series could be seen as a longarc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain powernamely that their past leaves them too broken to do anything but commit brutal acts in their own turn and that their personal liberation does not affect the social change needed to protect others from suffering
