Detailed discussion of genre, if it can be cited to reliable sources, belongs in the article body, not the lead sentence. --&gt; [[Drama (film and television)|drama]] television series created by [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]]. It is an adaptation of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', [[George R. R. Martin]]'s series of fantasy novels, the first of which is ''[[A Game of Thrones]]''. It is filmed in [[Belfast]] and elsewhere in [[Northern Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], [[Iceland]], [[Malta]], [[Morocco]], [[Scotland]], [[Spain]], and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.skyscanner.net/news/38-amazing-game-thrones-locations-pictures |title=Winter is here: 44 Game of Thrones locations in pictures |website=[[Skyscanner]] |first=Catherine |last=McGloin |date=July 11, 2017 |accessdate=October 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on [[HBO]] in the United States on April 17, 2011, and its seventh season ended on August 27, 2017. The series will conclude with its [[Game of Thrones (season 8)|eighth season]] premiering in April 2019.&lt;ref name="finalseason"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/02/game-of-thrones-prequel-final-season-interview/ |title=Game of Thrones: HBO clarifies prequels, final seasons plan |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=June 2, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602204015/http://ew.com/tv/2017/06/02/game-of-thrones-prequel-final-season-interview/ |archivedate=June 2, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="April2019"/&gt;

Set on the fictional continents of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|Westeros and Essos]], ''Game of Thrones'' has several plot lines and a large [[ensemble cast]] but centers on three primary [[story arc]]s. The first story arc centers on the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]] of the [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire#Westeros|Seven Kingdoms]] and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the dynastic noble families either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from the throne. The second story arc focuses on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, exiled and plotting a return to the throne. The third story arc centers on the longstanding brotherhood charged with defending the realm against the ancient threats of the fierce peoples and legendary creatures that lie far north, and an impending winter that threatens the realm.

''Game of Thrones'' has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international [[Fandom|fan base]]. It has been acclaimed by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) has been criticized.&lt;!-- See the "critical reception" section for references. The lead is a summary and as such is normally not footnoted. --&gt; The series has received 47 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, including [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] in 2015, 2016, and 2018, more than any other primetime scripted television series. Its [[List of awards and nominations received by Game of Thrones|other awards and nominations]] include three [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation]] (2012–2014), a 2011 [[Peabody Award]], and five nominations for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama]] (2012 and 2015–2018).

[[Showrunner]] David Benioff jokingly suggested "''[[The Sopranos]]'' in [[Middle-earth]]" as ''Game of Thrones''{{'}} [[tagline]], referring to its intrigue-filled plot and dark tone in a fantasy setting of magic and dragons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503185336/http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/47040/ |archivedate=May 3, 2016 |last=Kachka |first=Boris |title=Dungeon Master: David Benioff |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=May 18, 2008 |url=http://nymag.com/arts/books/features/47040/ |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 study of deaths per episode, it ranked second out of 40 recent U.S. TV drama series (with an average of 14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629182833/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-spartacus-vengeance-deadliest-shows-327911 |archivedate=June 29, 2016 |title='Game of Thrones' Topped by 'Spartacus: Vengeance' as TV's Deadliest Series |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-spartacus-vengeance-deadliest-shows-327911 |accessdate=May 23, 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=May 22, 2012 |first=Michael |last=O'Connell |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===

The series is generally praised for what is perceived as a sort of medieval realism.&lt;ref name="The Guardian March 22, 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Orr |first=David |authorlink=David Orr (journalist) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/books/review/george-r-r-martin-and-the-rise-of-fantasy.html |title=Dragons Ascendant: George R.

Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Richards |first=Linda |url=http://januarymagazine.com/profiles/grrmartin.html |title=January interview: George R.R.

A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between [[good and evil]], which Martin says does not mirror the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gevers |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Gevers |url=http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/nonfiction/intgrrm.htm |title=Sunsets of High Renown – An Interview with George R.

He introduced gray tones into a black-and-white universe."&lt;ref name="themes"/&gt;

In early seasons, under the influence of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' books, main characters were regularly killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers.&lt;ref name="ign 7.7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/game-of-thrones-the-dragon-and-the-wolf-review |title=Game of Thrones: "The Dragon and the Wolf" Review |publisher=IGN |accessdate=August 28, 2017 |date=August 27, 2017 |author=Fowler, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later seasons, critics pointed out that certain characters had developed "plot armor" to survive in unlikely circumstances, and attributed this to ''Game of Thrones'' deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.&lt;ref name="ign 7.7"/&gt; The series also reflects the substantial death rates in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kirschling |first=Gregory |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20161804,00.html |title=George R.R.

===Inspirations and derivations===
Although the first season closely follows the events of the first novel, later seasons have made significant changes. According to David Benioff, the series is "about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430065802/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/17/game-thrones-showrunners |archivedate=April 30, 2016 |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/17/game-thrones-showrunners |title=Game of Thrones showrunners answer burning season 5 questions |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |first=James |last=Hibberd |date=March 17, 2015 |accessdate=March 18, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holland further proposes that other historical antecedents of series elements include [[Hadrian's Wall]] (which becomes Martin's Wall), the [[Roman Empire]] and the legend of [[Atlantis]] (ancient [[Valyria]]), Byzantine [[Greek fire]] ("wildfire"), Icelandic [[saga]]s of the [[Viking Age]] (the [[Ironborn]]), the [[Mongol invasions and conquests|Mongol hordes]] (the [[Dothraki Sea|Dothraki]]), the [[Hundred Years' War]] and the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian March 24, 2013"/&gt; The series' popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin's skill at fusing these elements into a seamless, credible version of [[alternate history]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian March 24, 2013" /&gt; Martin acknowledges, "I take [history] and I file off the serial numbers and I [[up to eleven|turn it up to 11]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lipscomb |first=Suzannah |title=Game of Thrones has hacked our history |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/23/game-of-thrones-hacked-history-britains-bloody-past |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 23, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808193639/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/23/game-of-thrones-hacked-history-britains-bloody-past |archivedate=August 8, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

===Conception and development===
[[File:D. B. Weiss and David Benioff.jpg|thumb|alt=D. B. Weiss and David Benioff|Showrunners [[D. B. Weiss]] and [[David Benioff]] created the series, wrote most of its episodes and directed several.]]

In January 2006, David Benioff had a phone conversation with George R. R. Martin's literary agent about the books he represented, and became interested in ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' as he had been a fan of fantasy fiction when young but had not read the books before.  The literary agent then sent the first four books of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' to Benioff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gzYfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15#v=onepage |title=Inside HBO's Game of Thrones |first=Bryan |last=Cogman |publisher=Gollancz |date=November 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161219212618/https://books.google.com/books?id=gzYfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15#v=onepage |archivedate=December 19, 2016 |df=mdy-all |isbn=9781473210400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, ''A Game of Thrones'', shared his enthusiasm with D. B. Weiss and suggested that they adapt Martin's novels into a television series; Weiss finished the first novel in "maybe 36 hours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Elvis |title=UpClose: Game of Thrones with David Benioff and D.

According to Benioff, they won Martin over with their answer to his question, "[[Jon Snow (character)#Parentage|Who is Jon Snow's mother?]]"&lt;ref name="variety 2"/&gt;

{{quote box |width=30em |bgcolor=White |align=left |quote=I had worked in Hollywood myself for about 10 years, from the late '80s to the '90s. I'd been on the staff of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]''. All of my first drafts tended to be too big or too expensive. I always hated the process of having to cut.

R. Martin, author&lt;ref name="entertainment_weekly2011"/&gt;}}

Before being approached by Benioff and Weiss, Martin had had other meetings with other scriptwriters, most of them wanting to turn it into a feature film. Martin, however, deemed it "unfilmable" and impossible to be done as a feature film, stating that the size of one of his novels is as long as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which had been adapted as three feature films.&lt;ref name="entertainment_weekly2011"/&gt; Similarly, Benioff also said that it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as the scale of the novels is too big for a feature film and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, "a fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That means no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that."&lt;ref name="themes"/&gt; Martin himself was pleased with the suggestion that they adapt it as an HBO series, saying that he "never imagined it anywhere else".&lt;ref name="long_story_short"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2p9dRl0yYo |title=HBO's 'Game of Thrones': Long Story Short |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I knew it couldn't be done as a network television series.

The series began development in January 2007.&lt;ref name="var"/&gt; HBO acquired the TV rights to the novels, with Benioff and Weiss as its executive producers, and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes.&lt;ref name="var"/&gt; Initially, Martin would write one episode per season while Benioff and Weiss would write the rest of the episodes.&lt;ref name="var"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918180445/http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/32275-hello-from-benioff-and-weiss/page__st__40__p__1593863 |archivedate=September 18, 2013 |last=Benioff |first=David |author2=D.

Although many of the cast returned after the first season, the producers had many new characters to cast for each of the following seasons. Due to the large number of new characters, Benioff and Weiss postponed the introduction of several key characters in the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season]] and merged several characters into one or assigned plot functions to different characters.&lt;ref name="hibberd1"/&gt;  Some recurring characters were recast over the years; for example, [[Gregor Clegane]] was played by three different actors, while [[Dean-Charles Chapman]] who played [[Tommen Baratheon]] also played a minor Lannister character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-actors-roles-recast-2017-6 |title=These 8 'Game of Thrones' characters were recast — and you probably didn't even notice  |first= Kim |last=Renfro |date= June 21, 2017|work= Insider |accessdate=March 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[File:George R.R. Martin at Archipelacon.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=George R. R. Martin|George R. R. Martin, author of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', is a series co-[[executive producer]] and wrote one episode for each of the first four seasons.]]

''Game of Thrones'' used seven writers in six seasons. Series creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D. B. Weiss]], the showrunners, write most of the episodes each season.&lt;ref name="observer"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903222758/http://observer.com/2015/04/blood-caffeine-sex-magic-how-game-of-thrones-gets-written/ |archivedate=September 3, 2016 |url=http://observer.com/2015/04/blood-caffeine-sex-magic-how-game-of-thrones-gets-written/ |title=Blood Caffeine Sex Magic: How 'Game of Thrones' Gets Written |work=[[New York Observer]] |first=Sean T. |last=Collins |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 15, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' author [[George R. R. Martin]] wrote one episode in each of the first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the later seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel (''[[The Winds of Winter]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/george-rr-martin-not-writing-game-of-thrones-season-6-episode |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/george-rr-martin-not-writing-game-of-thrones-season-6-episode |title=George R.

[[Bryan Cogman]], initially a script coordinator for the series,&lt;ref name="espenson"/&gt; was promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at least one episode for the first five seasons, is the only other writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss. Before his promotion, [[Vanessa Taylor]] (a writer during the second and third seasons) worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. [[Dave Hill (screenwriter)|Dave Hill]] joined the writing staff for the fifth season after working as an assistant to Benioff and Weiss.&lt;ref name="vanity fair"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101102954/http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/game-of-thrones-benioff-weiss-interview |archivedate=January 1, 2015 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/vf-hollywood/game-of-thrones-benioff-weiss-interview |title=The Surprising Connection Between ''Game of Thrones'' and ''Monty Python'' |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=March 24, 2014 |accessdate=September 7, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Martin is not in the writers' room, he reads the script outlines and makes comments.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;

Benioff and Weiss sometimes assign characters to particular writers; for example, Cogman was assigned to Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another two to three weeks discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; A detailed outline is created, with each of the writers working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took a month and a half to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two [[film crew|units]] in different countries.&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt;

Benioff and Weiss write each of their episodes together, with one of them writing the first half of the script and the other the second half. After that they begin with passing the drafts back and forth to make notes and rewrite parts of it.&lt;ref name="long_story_short"/&gt;

The first season's southern scenes were filmed in Malta, a change in location from the  pilot episode's Moroccan sets.&lt;ref name="gotfactsheet"/&gt; The city of [[Mdina]] was used for King's Landing. Filming was also done at [[Fort Manoel]] (representing the Sept of Baelor), at the [[Azure Window]] on the island of [[Gozo]] (the Dothraki wedding site) and at [[San Anton Palace]], [[Fort Ricasoli]], [[Fort St. Angelo]] and St. Dominic monastery (all used for scenes in the Red Keep).&lt;ref name="USA Today March 30, 2012" /&gt;

[[File:Dubrovnik crop.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The walled city of Dubrovnik|The walled city of Dubrovnik became King's Landing in season two.]]
Filming of the second season's southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of [[Dubrovnik]] and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The [[Walls of Dubrovnik]] and [[Fort Lovrijenac]] were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of [[Lokrum]], the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of [[Trogir]], the [[Rector's Palace, Dubrovnik|Rector's Palace]] in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the [[Vatnajökull]] glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near [[Skaftafell]] and the [[Mýrdalsjökull]] glacier near [[Vík í Mýrdal|Vik]] on Höfðabrekkuheiði.&lt;ref name="USA Today March 30, 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="location iceland"&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826083416/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/iceland/articles/game-of-thrones-iceland-tour-filming-locations/ |archivedate=August 26, 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/iceland/articles/game-of-thrones-iceland-tour-filming-locations/ |title=Iceland's most spectacular Game of Thrones filming locations |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Oliver |last=Smith |date=June 7, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-season production returned to Dubrovnik, with the Walls of Dubrovnik, Fort Lovrijenac and nearby locations again used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. [[Trsteno Arboretum]], a new location, is the garden of the Tyrells in King's Landing. The third season also returned to Morocco (including the city of [[Essaouira]]) to film Daenerys' scenes in Essos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617031757/http://www.salon.com/2014/04/29/the_7_kingdoms_in_game_of_thrones_are_actually_these_5_real_world_places_partner/ |archivedate=June 17, 2016 |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/29/the_7_kingdoms_in_game_of_thrones_are_actually_these_5_real_world_places_partner/ |title=The 7 kingdoms in 'Game of Thrones' are actually these 5 real-world places |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |first=Jessica |last=Phelan |date=April 29, 2014 |accessdate=August 23, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dimmuborgir]] and the [[Grjótagjá]] cave in Iceland were used as well.&lt;ref name="location iceland"/&gt; One scene, with [[Bart the Bear 2|a live bear]], was filmed in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016062544/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/01/game-of-thrones-casts-a-bear-and-shoots-in-los-angeles-for-major-season-3-scene.html |archivedate=October 16, 2013 |title='Game of Thrones' casts a bear and shoots in Los Angeles for major Season 3 scene |last=Schwartz |first=Terri |date=January 28, 2013 |publisher=[[Zap2it]] |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/01/game-of-thrones-casts-a-bear-and-shoots-in-los-angeles-for-major-season-3-scene.html |accessdate=March 8, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production used three units (Dragon, Wolf and Raven) filming in parallel, six directing teams, 257 cast members and 703 crew members.&lt;ref name="Making" /&gt;

===Directing===
Each ten-episode season of ''Game of Thrones'' has four to six directors, who usually direct back-to-back episodes. [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]] has directed seven episodes, the most episodes of the series. [[Alex Graves]], [[David Nutter]], [[Mark Mylod]] and [[Jeremy Podeswa]] have directed six each. [[Daniel Minahan]] directed five episodes, and [[Michelle MacLaren]], [[Alik Sakharov]], and [[Miguel Sapochnik]] directed four each. [[Brian Kirk]] directed three episodes during the first season, and [[Tim Van Patten]] directed the series' first two episodes. [[Neil Marshall]] directed two episodes, both with large battle scenes: "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]" and "[[The Watchers on the Wall]]". Other directors have been [[Jack Bender]], [[David Petrarca]], [[Daniel Sackheim]], [[Michael Slovis]] and [[Matt Shakman]].&lt;ref name="Directors"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/game-of-thrones-season-7/ |title=Game of Thrones season 7: US and UK air date, teaser trailer, official poster, cast, rumors, and everything you need to know |work=GamesRadar |accessdate=April 4, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404215853/http://www.gamesradar.com/game-of-thrones-season-7/ |archivedate=April 4, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Benioff and D.

===Technical aspects===
[[Alik Sakharov]] was the pilot's cinematographer. The series has had a number of cinematographers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinematographers.nl/PaginasDoPh/sakharov.htm |title=ALIK SAKHAROV ASC |publisher=Cinematographers |accessdate=August 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125162551/http://www.cinematographers.nl/PaginasDoPh/sakharov.htm |archivedate=January 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has received seven [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series]] nominations.&lt;ref name="emmys.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/game-thrones |title=Game of Thrones |publisher=[[Emmy Award|Emmys.com]] |accessdate=February 21, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413192605/http://www.emmys.com/shows/game-thrones |archivedate=April 13, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The costumes used in the series drew inspiration from a number of sources, such as [[Japanese armor|Japanese]] and [[Persian clothing|Persian]] armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the [[Bedouin]] (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the [[Inuit]].&lt;ref name="wischhover20120604"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed/ |title=Game of Thrones' Hair and Wardrobe Secrets Revealed |work=Fashionista |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=June 6, 2012 |author=Wischhover, Cheryl |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling [[catgut]].&lt;ref name="Snead, Elizabeth"&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/game-thrones-michelle-clapton-costume-designer-emmy-335607 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fash-track/game-thrones-michelle-clapton-costume-designer-emmy-335607 |title='Game of Thrones' Designer Michelle Clapton's Secret Source for Wildling Bones: eBay |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=June 11, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012 |author=Snead, Elizabeth |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the extras who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can recognize the main characters. [[Björk]]'s [[Alexander McQueen]] high-neckline dresses inspired [[Margaery Tyrell]]'s funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal.&lt;ref name="wischhover20120604" /&gt; All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.&lt;ref name="Snead, Elizabeth"/&gt;

About two dozen wigs are used for the actresses. Made of human hair and up to {{convert|2|ft|cm}} in length, they cost up to $7,000 each and are washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs is time-consuming; [[Emilia Clarke]], for example, requires about two hours to style her brunette hair with a platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as [[Jack Gleeson]] and [[Sophie Turner]], receive frequent [[hair coloring]]. For characters such as Daenerys (Clarke) and her Dothraki, their hair, wigs and costumes are processed to appear as if they have not been washed for weeks.&lt;ref name="wischhover20120604"/&gt;

===Makeup===
For the first three seasons, [[Paul Engelen]] was ''Game of Thrones''{{'}} main makeup designer and [[Prosthetic makeup|prosthetic makeup artist]] with Melissa Lackersteen, [[Conor O'Sullivan (make-up artist)|Conor O'Sullivan]] and Rob Trenton. At the beginning of the fourth season Engelen's team was replaced by Jane Walker and her crew, composed of Ann McEwan and Barrie and Sarah Gower.&lt;ref name="emmys.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ |title=Game of Thrones Wins Big at Creative Arts Emmys |work=Westeros.org |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2016 |author=Elio |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
For the series' large number of [[visual effects]], HBO hired British-based BlueBolt and Irish-based Screen Scene for season one. Most of the environment builds were done as [[2.5D]] projections, giving viewers perspective while keeping the programming from being overwhelming.&lt;ref name=vfx-got&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514050245/http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Interview_with_VFX_Producer_Lucy_Ainsworth-Taylor/ |archivedate=May 14, 2016 |last1=Elio |title=Interview with VFX Producer Lucy Ainsworth-Taylor |url=http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Interview_with_VFX_Producer_Lucy_Ainsworth-Taylor/ |publisher=Westeros.org |date=June 22, 2011 |accessdate=August 18, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the season-one finale, "[[Fire and Blood (Game of Thrones)|Fire and Blood]]", was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects|Outstanding Special Visual Effects]].&lt;ref name="emmys.com"/&gt;

Because the effects became more complex in subsequent seasons (including [[Computer graphics|CGI]] creatures, fire, and water), German-based [[Pixomondo]] became the lead visual-effects producer; nine of its twelve facilities contributed to the project for season two, with [[Stuttgart]] the lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160718224036/http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones/ |archivedate=July 18, 2016 |title=Game of Thrones: Season 2 |url=http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones/ |publisher=[[Pixomondo]] |accessdate=August 19, 2014 |deadurl=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones-season-3/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |title=Game of Thrones: Season 3 |url=http://www.pixomondo.com/portfolio/game-of-thrones-season-3/ |publisher=Pixomondo |accessdate=August 19, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes were also produced by British-based Peanut FX, Canadian-based Spin VFX, and U.S.-based Gradient Effects. "[[Valar Morghulis]]" and "[[Valar Dohaeris]]" earned Pixomondo Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in 2012 and 2013, respectively.&lt;ref name="emmys.com"/&gt;

For season four, HBO added German-based Mackevision to the project.&lt;ref name=mckvsn&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821120407/http://mackevision.com/123live-user-data/user_data/6084/public/DOWNLOADS_DE/HOME/20140710_GOT_Nominierung_de.pdf |archivedate=August 21, 2014 |title=Mackevision erhält Emmy-Nominierung für visuelle Effekte in "Game of Thrones" – Pressemeldung |url=http://mackevision.com/123live-user-data/user_data/6084/public/DOWNLOADS_DE/HOME/20140710_GOT_Nominierung_de.pdf |publisher=Mackevision |date=July 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 19, 2014 |language=German |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season-four finale, "[[The Children (Game of Thrones)|The Children]]", won the 2014 Emmy Award for Visual Effects. Additional producers for season four included Canadian-based [[Rodeo FX]], German-based [[Scanline VFX]] and U.S.-based [[BAKED FX]]. The muscle and wing movements of the adolescent dragons in seasons four and five were based largely on those of a chicken. Pixomondo retained a team of 22 to 30 people which focused solely on visualizing Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/Game-of-thrones-dragons |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Johnson |first=Thomas |title=How 'Game of Thrones' creates its dragons |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/Game-of-thrones-dragons |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 12, 2015 |date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the fifth season, HBO added Canadian-based [[Image Engine]] and U.S.-based Crazy Horse Effects to its list of main visual-effects producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://image-engine.com/tv/game-of-thrones/ |title=Game of Thrones |publisher=Image Engine |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170716061155/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-prequels-are-we-getting-all-four-1020065 |archivedate=July 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chevfx.com/current-projects.php |title=Current Projects |publisher=Crazy Horse Effects |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601231708/http://www.chevfx.com/current-projects.php |archivedate=June 1, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
Unusual for a television series, the sound team receives a [[rough cut]] of a full season and approaches it as a ten-hour feature film. Although seasons one and two had different sound teams, one team has been in charge of sound since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asoundeffect.com/creating-the-fantastical-sound-of-game-of-thrones/ |title=This is how the fantastical sound of Game Of Thrones is made |last=Andersen |first=Asbjoern |publisher=A Sound Effect |date=August 6, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808063046/http://www.asoundeffect.com/creating-the-fantastical-sound-of-game-of-thrones/ |archivedate=August 8, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the series' blood-and-gore sounds, the team often uses a [[Chamois leather|chamois]]. For dragon screams, mating tortoises and dolphin, seal, lion and bird sounds have been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506065202/http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/06/game-of-thrones-sound-effects |archivedate=May 6, 2016 |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/06/game-of-thrones-sound-effects |title=Game of Thrones: The Secrets Behind All the Stabbings, Screams, and Sex Scenes |last=Calautti |first=Katie |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=August 6, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Title sequence===

The series' [[title sequence]] was created by production studio Elastic for HBO. [[Creative director]] [[Angus Wall]] and his collaborators received the 2011 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design|Main Title Design]] for the sequence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-2011-game-thrones-title-233780 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Fernandez |first=Sofia M. |title=Emmys 2011: 'Game of Thrones' Title Sequence Gives Series Its First Emmy |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/emmys-2011-game-thrones-title-233780 |accessdate=June 1, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 10, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts a [[Raised-relief map|three-dimensional map]] of [[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|the series' fictional world]].

===Language===

The Westerosi characters of ''Game of Thrones'' speak British-accented English, often (but not consistently) with the accent of the English region corresponding to the character's Westerosi region. The Northerner [[Eddard Stark]] speaks in actor Sean Bean's native [[Yorkshire accent|northern accent]], and the southern Lord Tywin Lannister speaks with a [[Received Pronunciation|southern accent]], while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish accent.&lt;ref name="Dissecting the real-world accents in Game of Thrones {{!}} Metro News"&gt;{{cite web |last1=McNeil |first1=Colin |title=Dissecting the real-world accents in Game of Thrones {{!}} Metro News|url=http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2016/06/24/dialect-coach-dissects-game-of-thrones-accents.html|website=[[Metro International#North America|Metro Toronto]]|publisher=Free Daily News Group Inc.|accessdate=April 20, 2017|location=[[Toronto]]|language=en|date=June 24, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421095418/http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2016/06/24/dialect-coach-dissects-game-of-thrones-accents.html|archivedate=April 21, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="With a wink to its audience, "&gt;{{cite web |last1=Epstein |first1=Adam |title=With a wink to its audience, "Game of Thrones" told its most annoying characters to shut up |url=https://qz.com/718066/with-a-wink-to-its-audience-game-of-thrones-told-its-most-annoying-characters-to-shut-up/ |work=[[Quartz (publication)|''Quartz'']] |accessdate=April 20, 2017 |language=English |date=June 27, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421094509/https://qz.com/718066/with-a-wink-to-its-audience-game-of-thrones-told-its-most-annoying-characters-to-shut-up/ |archivedate=April 21, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://gawker.com/what-is-going-on-with-the-accents-in-game-of-thrones-485816507 |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Read |first=Max |title=What Is Going on With the Accents in Game of Thrones? |url=http://gawker.com/what-is-going-on-with-the-accents-in-game-of-thrones-485816507 |accessdate=May 8, 2013 |publisher=[[Gawker]] |date=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast===
''Game of Thrones'' is broadcast by [[HBO]] in the United States and by its local subsidiaries or other [[pay television]] services in other countries, at the same time as in the U.S. or weeks (or months) later. The series' broadcast in China on [[China Central Television|CCTV]], begun in 2014, was heavily edited to remove scenes of sex and violence in accordance with a Chinese practice of censoring Western TV series to prevent what the ''[[People's Daily]]'' calls "negative effects and hidden security dangers". This resulted in viewer complaints about the incoherence of what remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1500897/game-thrones-premieres-cctv-viewers-call-it-edited-mess |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Blum |first=Jeremy |title=Game of Thrones premieres on CCTV, viewers call it an edited 'mess' |url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1500897/game-thrones-premieres-cctv-viewers-call-it-edited-mess |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |newspaper=[[South China Morning Post]] |date=April 30, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasters carrying ''Game of Thrones'' include [[Showcase (Australian TV channel)|Showcase]] in Australia; [[HBO Canada]], [[Super Écran]] and [[Showcase (Canadian TV channel)|Showcase]] in Canada; [[HBO Latin America]] in [[Latin America]]; [[Soho (New Zealand)|SoHo]] and [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime]] in New Zealand, and [[Sky Atlantic]] in the United Kingdom and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805221338/http://winter-is-coming.net/features/international-airings/ |archivedate=August 5, 2011 |url=http://www.winter-is-coming.net/features/international-airings |title=International Game of Thrones airings |publisher=WinterIsComing.net |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and achievements==
''Game of Thrones'' was highly anticipated by fans before its premiere,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120193535/http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jul/22/game-of-thrones-most-anticipated |archivedate=November 20, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/jul/22/game-of-thrones-most-anticipated |title=Is A Game of Thrones the most eagerly anticipated TV show ever? |date=July 23, 2010 |work=[[The Guardian]] |first=Mathilda |last=Gregory |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |location=London |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/08/with-game-of-thrones-hbo-is-plotting-for-another-true-blood.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Colins |first=Scott |title=With 'Game of Thrones,' HBO is playing for another 'True Blood' |date=August 8, 2010 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/08/with-game-of-thrones-hbo-is-plotting-for-another-true-blood.html |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has become a critical and commercial success. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', by 2014 it was "the biggest drama" and "the most talked about show" on television.&lt;ref name="The Guardian March 22, 2014"&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920154652/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/22/game-of-thrones-whats-not-to-love |archivedate=September 20, 2016 |last=Hughes |first=Sarah |title='Sopranos meets Middle-earth': how Game of Thrones took over our world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/22/game-of-thrones-whats-not-to-love |accessdate=March 22, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 22, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence===
Although ''Game of Thrones'' was dismissed by some critics before it began,&lt;ref name="The Guardian March 22, 2014"/&gt; its success has been credited with an increase in the popularity of the [[fantasy]] genre. On the eve of the [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second season's]] premiere, a [[CNN.com]] blog post by Joel Williams read, "After this weekend, you may be hard pressed to find someone who isn't a fan of some form of [[epic fantasy]]" and cited [[Ian Bogost]] as saying that the series continues a trend of successful screen adaptations beginning with [[Peter Jackson]]'s 2001 [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] and the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] establishing fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are "[[gateway drugs]] to fantasy fan culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927162257/http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/30/mainstream-finally-believes-fantasy-fans/ |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |last=Williams |first=Joel |title=Mainstream finally believes fantasy fans |url=http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/30/mainstream-finally-believes-fantasy-fans/ |accessdate=April 5, 2012 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=March 30, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its success in the face of its genre was attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture, frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.&lt;ref name="The Guardian March 22, 2014" /&gt;

The series' popularity increased [[A Song of Ice and Fire#Sales|sales of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels]] (republished in tie-in editions), which remained at the top of bestseller lists for months. According to ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', ''Game of Thrones'' was a favorite of [[sitcom]] writers and the series has been referred to in other TV series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/21/game-of-thrones-modern-family-parks-and-rec-writers-on-why-they-love-the-hbo-drama.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Lacob |first=Jace |title='Game of Thrones': 'Modern Family,' 'Parks and Rec' Writers on Why They Love the HBO Drama |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/09/21/game-of-thrones-modern-family-parks-and-rec-writers-on-why-they-love-the-hbo-drama.html |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=September 21, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With other fantasy series, it has been cited for an increase in the purchase (and abandonment) of [[huskies]] and other wolf-like dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/game-of-thrones-inspired-huskie-craze-goes-cold-as-owners-give-up-on-dogs-8431188.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=O'Brian |first=Liam |title=Game of Thrones inspired Huskie craze goes cold as owners give up on dogs |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/game-of-thrones-inspired-huskie-craze-goes-cold-as-owners-give-up-on-dogs-8431188.html |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=December 26, 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Game of Thrones'' has added to the popular vocabulary. The first season's scene in which Petyr Baelish explains his motives (or background) while prostitutes had sex in the background gave rise to the word "[[sexposition]]" for providing [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] with sex and nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328073923/http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama? |archivedate=March 28, 2013 |last=Hann |first=Michael |title=How 'sexposition' fleshes out the story |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama? |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 11, 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[World of A Song of Ice and Fire|Dothraki]]", the series' nomadic horsemen, was ranked fourth in a September 2012 [[Global Language Monitor]] list of words from television most used on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/09/25/and-the-top-television-words-of-the-year-are/ |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Steinmetz |first=Kate |title=And the Top TV Words of the Year Are&amp;nbsp;...|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/09/25/and-the-top-television-words-of-the-year-are/ |accessdate=September 27, 2012 |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 25, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the media used "Game of Thrones" as a figure of speech or comparison for situations of intense conflict and deceit, such as [[National Federation of Independent Business v.

"Khaleesi" has increased in popularity as a name for baby girls in the United States. In the novels and the TV series, the word is a title meaning the wife of a Khal (warlord) in the [[Dothraki language]] held by [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and not actually a name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819190426/http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2014/04/there-are-now-more-babies-named-khaleesi-than-betsy-or-nadine-in-the-us.html |archivedate=August 19, 2016 |last=O'Neil |first=Lauren |title=There are now more babies named 'Khaleesi' than 'Betsy' or 'Nadine' in the U.S. |url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/yourcommunity/2014/04/there-are-now-more-babies-named-khaleesi-than-betsy-or-nadine-in-the-us.html |date=April 11, 2014 |newspaper=[[CBC News]] |accessdate=April 27, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Game of Thrones'' has received critical acclaim, although the series' frequent use of nudity and violence has been criticized. Its seasons have appeared on annual "best of" lists published by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (2011), ''[[TIME Magazine|TIME]]'' (2011 and 2012) and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305075523/http://winter-is-coming.net/2011/12/thrones-lands-on-tons-of-top-tv-shows-of-2011-lists/ |archivedate=March 5, 2013 |title=Thrones lands on tons of top TV shows of 2011 lists |url=http://winter-is-coming.net/2011/12/thrones-lands-on-tons-of-top-tv-shows-of-2011-lists/ |publisher=WinterIsComing.net |date=December 23, 2011 |accessdate=December 23, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://grrm.livejournal.com/255830.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Martin |first=George R.

Despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics, ''Game of Thrones'' has been criticized for the amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence (especially against women) it depicts, and for the manner in which it depicts these themes. ''[[The Atlantic]]'' called the series' "tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence" of the source material "the defining weakness" of the adaptation.&lt;ref name="Atlantic"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826014749/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/game-of-thrones-roundtable-season-5-episode-six-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/393503/ |archivedate=August 26, 2016 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/05/game-of-thrones-roundtable-season-5-episode-six-unbowed-unbent-unbroken/393503/ |title=Game of Thrones: A Pointless Horror and a Ridiculous Fight |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |last2=Orr |first2=Christopher |last3=Sullivan |first3=Amy |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=May 17, 2015 |accessdate=May 18, 2015 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; George R. R. Martin responded that he feels obliged to be truthful about history and human nature, and that rape and sexual violence are common in war; and that omitting them from the narrative would have rung false and undermined one of [[#Themes|his novels' themes]], its historical realism.&lt;ref name="New York Times May 2, 2014" /&gt; HBO said that they "fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David's exceptional work and we feel this work speaks for itself."&lt;ref name="New York Times May 2, 2014" /&gt;

The amount of sex and nudity in the series, especially in scenes that are incidental to the plot, was the focus of much of the criticism aimed at the series in its [[Game of Thrones (season 1)|first]] and [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|second seasons]]. [[Stephen Dillane]], who portrays [[Stannis Baratheon]], likened the series' frequent explicit scenes to "German porn from the 1970s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/14/game-of-thrones-stephen-dillane-the-tunnel_n_4595628.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Frost |first=Caroline |title='Game of Thrones' Star Stephen Dillane Admits the Nudity Is Like 'German Porn from the 1970s' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/14/game-of-thrones-stephen-dillane-the-tunnel_n_4595628.html |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=January 14, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlie Anders]] wrote in [[io9]] that while the first season was replete with light-hearted "[[sexposition]]", the second season appeared to focus on distasteful, exploitative, and dehumanizing sex with little informational content.&lt;ref name="io9 2 May 2012"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911064821/http://io9.com/5906540/is-game-of-thrones-gratiutious-sex-worse-than-the-gratuitous-violence |archivedate=September 11, 2015 |last=Anders |first=Charlie Jane |title=Is Game of Thrones' gratuitous sex worse than the gratuitous violence? |url=http://io9.com/5906540/is-game-of-thrones-gratiutious-sex-worse-than-the-gratuitous-violence |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |work=[[io9]] |date=May 2, 2012 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Anna Holmes, the nude scenes appeared to be aimed mainly at titillating heterosexual men, right down to the Brazilian waxes sported by the women in the series' faux-medieval setting, which made these scenes alienating to other viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Holmes |first=Anna |title=Skin is wearing thin on HBO's 'Game of Thrones' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/skin-is-wearing-thin-on-hbos-game-of-thrones/2012/04/26/gIQA4hd6jT_story_1.html |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527173457/http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/skin-is-wearing-thin-on-hbos-game-of-thrones/2012/04/26/gIQA4hd6jT_story_1.html |archivedate=May 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Huffington Post]]''{{'}}s Maureen Ryan likewise noted that ''Game of Thrones'' mostly presented women naked, rather than men, and that the excess of "random boobage" undercut any aspirations the series might have to address the oppression of women in a feudal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502120407/http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-season-1-episode-7-recap/ |archivedate=May 2, 2012 |last=Ryan |first=Maureen |title='Game of Thrones' Season 1, Episode 7 Recap |url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-season-1-episode-7-recap/ |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=[[AOL TV]] |date=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed the series as retaining a thirteen-year-old boy as a consultant whose main concern was showing as many breasts as possible.&lt;ref name="io9 2 May 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Toder |first=Matt |title=SNL Explains the Nudity in Game of Thrones |url=http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=Gawker |date=April 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Breaker of Chains#Rape scene|A scene]] in the [[Game of Thrones (season 4)|fourth season's]] episode "[[Breaker of Chains]]", in which [[Jaime Lannister]] rapes his sister and lover [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], triggered a broad public discussion about the series' depiction of sexual violence against women. According to Dave Itzkoff of ''[[The New York Times]]'', the scene caused outrage, in part because of comments by director [[Alex Graves]] that the scene became "consensual by the end". Itzkoff also wrote that critics fear that "rape has become so pervasive in the drama that it is almost background noise: a routine and unshocking occurrence".&lt;ref name="New York Times May 2, 2014"&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821120407/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/arts/television/for-game-of-thrones-rising-unease-over-rapes-recurring-role.html |archivedate=August 21, 2016 |last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |title=For 'Game of Thrones,' Rising Unease Over Rape's Recurring Role |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/arts/television/for-game-of-thrones-rising-unease-over-rapes-recurring-role.html |accessdate=May 4, 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 2, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonia Saraiya of ''[[The A.V.

As the sixth and seventh seasons saw Daenerys, Sansa and Cersei assume ruling positions, Alyssa Rosenberg of the ''Washington Post'' noted that the series could be seen as a "long-arc revenge fantasy about what happens when women who have been brutalized and raped gain power"—namely, that their past leaves them too broken to do anything but commit brutal acts in their own turn, and that their personal liberation does not affect the social change needed to protect others from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Alyssa |title=The arguments about women and power in 'Game of Thrones' have never been more unsettling |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/08/09/the-arguments-about-women-and-power-in-game-of-thrones-have-never-been-more-unsettling/ |accessdate=August 9, 2017 |work=The Washington Post |date=August 9, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809212138/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2017/08/09/the-arguments-about-women-and-power-in-game-of-thrones-have-never-been-more-unsettling/ |archivedate=August 9, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Successor shows===

{{quote box|quoted=true|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=Taking place thousands of years before the events of ''Game of Thrones'', the series chronicles the world's descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour.

In May 2017, after years of speculation about possible [[Spin-off (media)|successor shows]], HBO commissioned [[Max Borenstein]], [[Jane Goldman]], [[Brian Helgeland]], [[Carly Wray]] and a fifth unnamed writer to develop individual ''Game of Thrones'' successor series. All of the writers were to be working individually with George R. R. Martin, who also co-wrote two of the scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Goldberg |first1=Lesley |title='Game of Thrones': Fifth "Successor Show" in the Works at HBO, George R.R.

B. Weiss and David Benioff said that they would not be involved with any of the projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans.&lt;ref name="finalseason"/&gt; Martin said that all the concepts under discussion were prequels, though he believes the term "successor show" applies better to these projects, as they are not ''Game of Thrones'' spinoffs in the traditional sense. He ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea, and revealed that some may be set outside Westeros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html |title=About Those Spinoffs ...|first=George R.R. |last=Martin |date=May 14, 2017 |website=Not A Blog|access-date=August 6, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814193454/http://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html |archivedate=August 14, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2018, HBO commissioned a [[Television pilot|pilot]] to a ''Game of Thrones'' prequel series from Goldman as showrunner and Martin as co-creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/06/08/game-thrones-prequel-jane-goldman/|title=Breaking: 'Game of Thrones' prequel pilot ordered by HBO.

Notable events of that period include the foundation of powerful Houses, the Long Night when the White Walkers first descended upon Westeros, and the Andal Invasion when the Andals invaded from Essos and conquered most of Westeros.&lt;ref name="IGN 180616" /&gt; Writing in a blog post in June 2018, Martin suggested "The Long Night" as a title for the upcoming series, and revealed that the filming location, the cast and the director for the pilot episode were yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/06/11/hbo-greenlights-goldman-pilot/ |title=HBO Greenlights Goldman Pilot |author=George R.
