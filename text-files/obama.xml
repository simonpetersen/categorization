Obama was born in 1961 in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], two years after the territory was [[Hawaii Admission Act|admitted to the Union]] as the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|50th state]]. After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1983, he worked as a [[community organizer]] in [[Chicago]]. In 1988, he enrolled in [[Harvard Law School]], where he was the first black president of the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. After graduating, he became a [[civil rights]] attorney and an [[Academy#Academic_personnel|academic]], teaching [[constitutional law]] at the [[University of Chicago Law School]] from 1992 to 2004. He [[Illinois Senate career of Barack Obama|represented the 13th district for three terms]] in the [[Illinois Senate]] from 1997 to 2004, when he [[United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004|ran for the U.S. Senate]]. He received national attention in 2004 with his March primary win, his well-received July [[2004 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address]], and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|his campaign]] began and after [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|a close primary campaign]] against [[Hillary Clinton]]. He was [[United States presidential election, 2008|elected]] over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John McCain]] and was [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the [[2009 Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate.

During his first two years in office, Obama signed [[Presidency of Barack Obama#Major acts and legislation|many landmark bills]] into law. The main reforms were the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (often referred to as "Obamacare", shortened as the "Affordable Care Act"), the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], and the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]]. The [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]] served as [[Stimulus (economics)|economic stimulus]] amidst the [[Great Recession]]. After a lengthy debate over the national [[United States debt ceiling|debt limit]], he signed the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|Budget Control]] and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|American Taxpayer Relief Acts]]. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Afghanistan]], reduced nuclear weapons with the United States–Russia [[New START]] treaty, and [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq|ended military involvement]] in the [[Iraq War]]. He ordered [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military involvement in Libya]] in opposition to [[Muammar Gaddafi]]; Gaddafi was [[Death of Muammar Gaddafi|killed by NATO-assisted forces]]. He also ordered the military operations that resulted in [[death of Osama bin Laden|the deaths of Osama bin Laden]] and suspected [[Yemen]]i [[Al-Qaeda]] operative [[Anwar al-Awlaki]].

After winning [[United States presidential election, 2012|re-election]] by defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent [[Mitt Romney]], Obama was [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|sworn in for a second term]] in 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusiveness for [[LGBT American]]s. His administration filed briefs that urged the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to strike down [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]] bans as unconstitutional (''[[United States v. Windsor]]'' and ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''); same-sex marriage was fully [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|legalized]] in 2015 after the Court ruled that a same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges|Obergefell]]''. He advocated for [[Gun politics in the United States|gun control]] in response to the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], indicating support for a ban on [[assault weapons]], and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning [[climate change]] and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|military intervention in Iraq]] in response to [[Iraqi insurgency (2011–13)|gains made]] by [[ISIL]] after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan|ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan]] in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 [[Paris Agreement]] on global climate change, initiated [[International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis|sanctions against Russia]] following the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|invasion in Ukraine]] and again after [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], brokered a [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], and [[United States–Cuban Thaw|normalized U.S. relations with Cuba]].

==== Religious views ====
Obama is a [[Protestant]] Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life.&lt;ref name="Christian" /&gt; He wrote in ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'' that he "was not raised in a religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known." He described his father as a "confirmed [[Atheism|atheist]]" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change."&lt;ref name="social change" /&gt;

Obama called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.&lt;ref name="health reform" /&gt; He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900&amp;nbsp;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the [[public health insurance option|public option]], to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.html |title = Obama, Armed With Details, Says Health Plan Is Necessary |author = Stolberg, Sheryl Gay |author2 = Zeleny, Jeff |date = September 9, 2009 |newspaper = The New York Times |accessdate = July 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Mike |last = Allen |url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/26907.html |title = Barack Obama will hedge on public option |website = [[Politico]] |accessdate = July 5, 2015 |date = September 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACA includes [[Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health-related provisions]], most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding [[Medicaid]] eligibility for people making up to 133%&amp;nbsp;of the [[federal poverty level]] (FPL) starting in 2014,&lt;ref name="cnn_ref1"&gt;{{cite news |last = Rice |first = Sabriya |url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/03/25/health.care.law.basics/index.html |title = 5 key things to remember about health care reform |publisher = CNN |date = March 25, 2010 |accessdate = January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400%&amp;nbsp;of the FPL ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum "out-of-pocket" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income,&lt;ref name="whitehouse" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Grier |first = Peter |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0320/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-gets-subsidized-insurance |date = March 20, 2010 |title = Health Care Reform Bill 101 |newspaper = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate = July 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing [[health insurance exchange]]s, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research.

The costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new Medicare taxes for those in high-income [[tax bracket|brackets]], taxes on [[indoor tanning]], cuts to the [[Medicare Advantage]] program in favor of traditional Medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Grier |first = Peter |date = March 21, 2010 |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0321/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-will-pay-for-reform |title = Health care reform bill 101: Who will pay for reform? |journal = Christian Science Monitor |accessdate = July 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0319/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-must-buy-insurance |title = Health care reform bill 101: Who must buy insurance? |last = Grier |first = Peter |date = March 19, 2010 |work = [[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate = April 7, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100405075157/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2010/0319/Health-care-reform-bill-101-Who-must-buy-insurance |archivedate = April 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the CBO estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143&amp;nbsp;billion over the first decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Elmendorf |first = Douglas W. |title = H.R. 4872, Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Final Health Care Legislation) |url = http://www.cbo.gov/publication/21351 |publisher = Congressional Budget Office |accessdate = January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v.

In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in ''[[King v. Burwell]]'' that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans "established by the State", as the statute reads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/25/supreme-court-upholds-obamacare-subsidies-in-king-v-burwell |title=Supreme Court Upholds Obamacare Subsidies |author=Kimberly Leonard |website=US News &amp; World Report |accessdate=November 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116072123/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/25/supreme-court-upholds-obamacare-subsidies-in-king-v-burwell |archivedate=January 16, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Energy policy ====
{{Main|Energy policy of the Obama administration}}
Prior to June 2014, Obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based "All of the above" approach to domestic [[energy policy]], which Obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his [[State of the Union]] speech in January 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. In June 2014, Obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=James P.

After President Trump announced his withdrawal of the United States from the [[Paris Agreement]] on June 1, Obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: "But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/01/politics/obama-paris-climate/|title=Obama pans Trump withdrawal from climate deal|first=MJ|last=Lee|date=June 1, 2017|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the PPACA, including a "skinny repeal", have thus far failed.&lt;ref name="legacy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/obama-legacy-recovery-recession-affordable-care-act-44927003|title=Obama Legacy Will Be Recovery from Recession, Affordable Care Act|date=January 20, 2017|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act]] amendment, it represents the [[Health care in the United States|U.S. healthcare system]]'s most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="Oberlander2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oberlander|first1=Jonathan|title=Long Time Coming: Why Health Reform Finally Passed|journal=Health Affairs|date=June 1, 2010|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1112–1116|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2010.0447|pmid=20530339|url=http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/6/1112.full|language=en|issn=0278-2715|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205105530/http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/29/6/1112.full|archivedate=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blumenthal2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blumenthal|first1=David|last2=Abrams|first2=Melinda|last3=Nuzum|first3=Rachel|title=The Affordable Care Act at 5 Years |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=June 18, 2015 | volume=372 |issue=25 |pages=2451–2458|doi=10.1056/NEJMhpr1503614|pmid=25946142| issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CohenEtAl"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Alan B.|last2=Colby|first2=David C.|last3=Wailoo|first3=Keith A.|last4=Zelizer|first4=Julian E. | title=Medicare and Medicaid at 50: America's Entitlement Programs in the Age of Affordable Care|date=June 1, 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0190231569|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H9DGBwAAQBAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTsigning"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stolberg|first1=Sheryl Gay|last2=Pear|first2=Robert | title=Obama Signs Health Care Overhaul into Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/health/policy/24health.html| work=The New York Times|date=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened [[Depression (economics)|depression]] and pulling the economy back from the [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name="legacy" /&gt; According to the [[U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics]], the [[Obama administration]] created 11.3&amp;nbsp;million jobs from the month after [[first inauguration of Barack Obama|his first inauguration]] to the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Long|first1=Heather|title=Final tally: Obama created 11.3 million jobs|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/06/news/economy/obama-over-11-million-jobs/| publisher=CNN|date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Obama signed into effect the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].

In 2009, Obama signed into law the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010]], which contained in it the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]], the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded [[Hate crime laws in the United States|existing federal hate crime laws in the United States]] to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

According to [[Pew Research Center]] and [[United States Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2015, that inmates sentenced in US federal custody declined by 5% under Obama.
