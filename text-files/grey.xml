'''''Grey's Anatomy''''' is an American medical drama television series that premiered on March 27, 2005, on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) as a [[mid-season replacement]]. The fictional series focuses on the lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns,]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and [[attending physician]]s, as they develop into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is a play on ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by [[Henry Gray]]. [[Shonda Rhimes]] developed the pilot and continues to write for the series; she is also one of the executive producers, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the series is set in [[Seattle]] (at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, later known as the Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital), it is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

The series was designed to be racially diverse and used [[color-blind casting]]. It revolves around the title character, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]], played by [[Ellen Pompeo]], first featured as an intern. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes through the series' run, with many members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|others]]. In its [[Grey's Anatomy (season 15)|fifteenth season]], the show has a large ensemble of eleven actors, including four characters from the original cast (Meredith Grey, Alex Karev, Miranda Bailey, and Richard Webber).

''Grey's Anatomy'' was renewed for a fifteenth season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2018/04/20/greys-anatomy-renewed-abc-season-15/|title=Grey's Anatomy Renewed for Season 15|first=Dave|last=Nemetz|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=April 21, 2018|work=TV Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered on September 27, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2018/07/24/abc-premiere-dates-fall-2018-greys-anatomy-the-conners/ |title=ABC Fall Premiere Dates: XL Grey's, Nathan Fillion's Rookie, The Conners (Minus Roseanne) and More |last=Swift |first=Andy |work=[[TVLine]] |date=July 24, 2018 |accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' success catapulted such long-running cast members as Pompeo, Dempsey, and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013.&lt;ref name="bustle2013"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Does The 'Grey's Anatomy' Cast Make?

''Grey's Anatomy'' ranks as ABC's highest-rated drama in its fourteenth season.

''Grey's Anatomy'' has been well received by critics throughout much of its run, and has been included in various critics' year-end top ten lists. Since its inception, the show has been described by the media outlets as a television "phenomenon" or a "juggernaut", owing to its longevity and dominant ratings. It is considered to have had a significant effect on [[popular culture]] and has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Grey's Anatomy|numerous awards]], including the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama]]. It has received thirty-eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, including two for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]]. The cast members have also received several accolades for their respective performances. ''Grey's Anatomy'' is the [[List of longest-running scripted U.S. primetime television series|longest-running scripted primetime show]] currently airing on ABC, the longest scripted primetime ABC show ever, and the second-longest primetime medical drama, after ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

== Plot ==
The series follows [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), the daughter of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside her fellow doctors [[Cristina Yang]] ([[Sandra Oh]]), [[Izzie Stevens]] ([[Katherine Heigl]]), [[Alex Karev]] ([[Justin Chambers]]), and [[George O'Malley]] ([[T. R. Knight]]), who each struggle to balance personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by [[Miranda Bailey]] ([[Chandra Wilson]]), a senior resident who works for attending [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), the head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; [[Preston Burke]] ([[Isaiah Washington]]), the head of cardio, who becomes Yang's fiancé; and [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and the previous lover of Ellis Grey. In the sixth season, these residents are joined by [[Jackson Avery]] ([[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]]) and [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger. During the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley, and Stevens all depart the series.

In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by [[Addison Montgomery]] ([[Kate Walsh (actress)|Kate Walsh]]), the head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery who leaves for Los Angeles after the third season; [[Callie Torres]] ([[Sara Ramirez]]), a resident who later becomes head of orthopedic surgery and leaves Seattle at the end of the twelfth season; [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), as head of plastics; [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), as head of trauma who later marries Yang; [[Arizona Robbins]] ([[Jessica Capshaw]]), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head of fetal surgery who marries Torres; [[Erica Hahn]] ([[Brooke Smith (actress)|Brooke Smith]]), as head of cardio; [[Teddy Altman]] ([[Kim Raver]]), as head of cardio who departs at the end of season eight but returns in season fourteen; and [[Amelia Shepherd]] ([[Caterina Scorsone]]), Derek's sister, who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.

New young doctors in the residency program include [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), Meredith's half-sister, who is killed with her love interest Mark Sloan in the season eight finale. Other additions include Leah Murphy ([[Tessa Ferrer]]), who departs near the end of the tenth season but returns during the thirteenth; Shane Ross ([[Gaius Charles]]), who departs with Yang in the tenth-season finale; Stephanie Edwards ([[Jerrika Hinton]]), who resigns during season thirteen; [[Jo Wilson]] (later Jo Karev) ([[Camilla Luddington]]), a doctor who begins a romantic relationship with Karev; Andrew Deluca ([[Giacomo Gianniotti]]), the love-interest of Meredith's half-sister Maggie Pierce ([[Kelly McCreary]]), who also serves as head of cardio; and Benjamin Warren ([[Jason George]]), an anesthesiologist-turned-resident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy|title=Watch Grey's Anatomy TV Show|website=ABC|access-date=April 20, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419202421/http://abc.go.com/shows/greys-anatomy|archivedate=April 19, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has to balance his own desire to succeed with his wife Miranda Bailey's new role as Chief of Surgery. Season eleven sees the departure of Derek Shepherd, and in season twelve, attending cardio surgeon Nathan Riggs ([[Martin Henderson]]) joins the show. In the early episodes of season fourteen, Riggs leaves the series to start a life with Owen's long-lost sister; by the season finale, Kepner and Robbins also depart the show.

==Production and development==

===Conception===
[[Shonda Rhimes]] wanted to make a show that she would enjoy watching,&lt;ref name=chicagotribune&gt;{{cite news|title=Shonda Rhimes, creator of 'Grey's Anatomy' and a Chicagoan of the Year|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/12/shonda_rhimes_a.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=May 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621165401/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/12/shonda_rhimes_a.html|archivedate=June 21, 2009 |last=Ryan|first=Maureen|date=December 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thought it would be interesting to create a show about "smart women competing against one another".&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

When asked how she decided to develop a [[medical drama]], Rhimes responded:

{{quote|I was obsessed with the surgery channels. ... My sisters and I would call each other up and talk about operations we'd seen on the [[Discovery Channel]]. There's something fascinating about the medical world—you see things you'd never imagine, like the fact that doctors talk about their boyfriends or their day while they're cutting somebody open. So when ABC asked me to write another pilot, the [operating room] seemed like the natural setting.&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Winfrey|first=Oprah|title=Oprah Talks to Shonda Rhimes|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Greys-Anatomy-Creator-Shonda-Rhimes/1|work=[[O: The Oprah Magazine|O, The Oprah Magazine]]|publisher=[[Harpo Productions|Harpo Productions, Inc]]|accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=December 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FR4uWWaD?url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-Greys-Anatomy-Creator-Shonda-Rhimes/1|archivedate=March 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The series was pitched to [[ABC Entertainment]], who gave the [[Green-light|green light]]. The show was picked up as a [[mid-season replacement]] for ''[[Boston Legal]]'' in the [[2004–05 United States network television schedule|2005 television season]].&lt;ref name="businesslibrary"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_12_60/ai_n15632370/ |title=Shonda Rhimes: the force behind Grey's Anatomy |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=Business Library |date=October 2005 |accessdate=May 24, 2012 |author=Collier, Aldore |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602112859/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_12_60/ai_n15632370/ |archivedate=June 2, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francie Calfo]], executive vice president of development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[m]edical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [Rhimes] found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{quote box|quote=''ER'' is high-speed medicine. The camera flies around, adrenaline is rushing. My show is more personal. The idea for the series began when a doctor told me it was incredibly hard to shave her legs in the hospital shower. At first that seemed like a silly detail. But then I thought about the fact that it was the only time and place this woman might have to shave her legs. That's how hard the work is.|source=—Rhimes on the creation of ''Grey's Anatomy''&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;|align=right|width=25em}}

Rhimes initially conceived ''Grey's Anatomy'' as a statement against racism. She worked to create a show featuring a racially diverse cast that allowed viewers to relate to characters regardless of race.&lt;ref name=inamerica&gt;{{cite news|last=Springer|first=Sarah|title='Grey's Anatomy' creator, actress discuss media diversity|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/22/greys-anatomy-creator-and-actress-discuss-media-diversity/|publisher=[[Cable News Network]]|work=InAmerica|accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=May 22, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FR4vPP2f?url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/22/greys-anatomy-creator-and-actress-discuss-media-diversity/|archivedate=March 27, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While creating characters, as well as writing the first script, the series' writers had no character descriptions in mind, and hoped to cast the best actor available for each part. Rhimes has said that if the network had not allowed to create characters this way, she would have been hesitant about moving forward with the series.&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt; Female roles in particular were developed as multi-faceted characters.

Rhimes offered her insight on this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted to create a world in which you felt as if you were watching very real women. Most of the women I saw on TV didn't seem like people I actually knew. They felt like ideas of what women are. They never got to be nasty or competitive or hungry or angry. They were often just the loving wife or the nice friend. But who gets to be the bitch? Who gets to be the three-dimensional woman?&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The show's title, ''Grey's Anatomy'', was devised as a play on words: a reference to both [[Henry Gray]]'s classic English medical textbook, ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'' (first published in 1858 and still in print), and the title character Dr. [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]).&lt;ref&gt;Roschke, Ryan (November 30, 2017).

===Filming locations and technique===

[[File:Seattle Space Needle Crop.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The space needle in Seattle, Washington.|The [[Space Needle]], in Seattle, is the background to many exterior shots.]]
Rhimes considered setting the medical drama in her hometown, [[Chicago]], but eventually decided to go with Seattle, to distinguish ''Grey's Anatomy'' from the Chicago–based series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.&lt;ref name=LAT1/&gt;

Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building of the former [[Fisher Communications]] (since merged into [[Sinclair Broadcasting Group]]) and SBG's ABC affiliated [[KOMO-TV|KOMO]] radio and television stations in [[Seattle]], is used for some exterior shots of Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital. In particular, [[air ambulance]]s land on the [[KOMO-TV]] newscopter's helipad. This suggests the hospital is close to the [[Space Needle]] (which is directly across the street from Fisher Plaza), the [[Seattle Monorail]], and other local landmarks.

But, the hospital used for most other exterior and a few interior shots is not in Seattle; these scenes are shot at the VA Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in [[North Hills, Los Angeles, California|North Hills]], California, and occasional shots from an interior walkway above the lobby show dry California mountains in the distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year=2005|title=Grey's Anatomy Season One DVD: Commentary Feature|publisher=[[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Entertainment]]|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exterior of Meredith Grey's house, also known as the Intern House, is real. In the show, the address of Grey's home is 613 Harper Lane, but this is not an actual address. The physical house is located at 303 W. Comstock St., on Queen Anne Hill, Seattle, Washington. Most scenes are taped at Prospect Studios in [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], just east of [[Hollywood]], where the ''Grey's Anatomy'' set occupies six sound stages. Some outside scenes are shot at the [[Magnuson Park|Warren G. Magnuson Park]] in Seattle. Several props used are working medical equipment, including the [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI machine]].&lt;ref name=filmed&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarendon|first=Dan|title=Where Is Grey's Anatomy Filmed, Anyway?|url=http://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/where-is-greys-anatomy-filmed-anyway|publisher=The Cambio Network|work=Wetpaint|accessdate=May 24, 2012|date=December 20, 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017095547/http://www.wetpaint.com/greys-anatomy/articles/where-is-greys-anatomy-filmed-anyway|archivedate=October 17, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series synopsis==

===Overview===
[[File:Greys Anatomy title.svg|right|thumb|270px|upright=1.3|Title screen|alt= The title screen of ''Grey{{'s}} Anatomy'']]
''Grey{{'}}s Anatomy'' follows the lives of [[Internship (medicine)|surgical interns]] and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually develop into seasoned doctors through the mentoring of their residents, attendings, and chiefs of surgery. Each installment typically begins with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the episode.&lt;ref name=GAMS&gt;{{cite web|last=Santucci |first=Pieracarla |title=Grey's Anatomy Made Simple |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/greys-anatomy-made-simple-4979.html?cat=39 |work=[[Associated Content|Yahoo!

After arriving at the hospital each morning, residents may argue over who gets the challenge of a certain patient who has arrived that day.&lt;ref name=WABLTW&gt;{{cite episode|title=Winning a Battle, Losing the War|credits=Writer: Rhimes, Shonda.

Once assigned a case, each doctor [[diagnosis|diagnoses]] the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Each episode typically features scenes of a surgery, towards the center of the episode.&lt;/ref&gt; The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life.&lt;ref name=ILYS&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked (Grey's Anatomy)|I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked]]|credits=Writers: Phelan, Tony and Rater, Joan.

Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an [[indie rock]] background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series.&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt; At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on the initial one.&lt;ref name="karanovic.org"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote=''Grey's Anatomy'' offers a different and perhaps more valuable idea of what it means to be strong: the capacity to suffer terribly, break down completely, and then get up again, confident that you're bigger than the sum of the tragedies you've suffered—because everyone else is, too. The layers of history have grown pretty dense and rich, and the friendships that form around them as the characters suffer and survive is the glue of the series, and what—despite a few inevitable hit-or-miss patches—elevates it to something special.|source=—Laura Hudson of ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/2015/06/binge-guide-greys-anatomy/ | work=Wired | first=Laura | last=Hudson | title=WIRED Binge-Watching Guide: Grey's Anatomy | date=June 24, 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321171604/https://www.wired.com/2015/06/binge-guide-greys-anatomy/ | archivedate=March 21, 2017 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|width=30em}}

''Grey's Anatomy'' has been well received among critics. The show holds an average score of 74% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/grey_s_anatomy "Grey's Anatomy (2005 - )"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127153156/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/grey_s_anatomy/ |date=November 27, 2017 }}. [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved June 27, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Todd VanDerWerf of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave an insight on the series' overwhelming success and the lows, writing that the quality arc is "all over the place". He noted the steady build-up in the first season; the series skyrocketing into a phenomenon in the second season; the gradual dip in season three; and "some seriously bumpy moments" in the fourth and the fifth season, which was interrupted by the writers' strike. VanDerWerff felt that the "climb begins again in season six".&lt;ref name="VanDerWerff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/sure-igreys-anatomyi-was-a-big-hit-but-was-it-good-99320|title=Sure, Grey's Anatomy was a big hit, but was it good TV?|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|website=[[The A.V.

Let me make it clear that I'm not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show's history, and most of them didn't last a full season." adding, "I still enjoy the show, and I'll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, ''Grey's Anatomy'' has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as 'McDreamy', the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if [[Shonda Rhimes]] has taken leave of her faculties, but it's also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." The site lauded the show saying, "On average, it's been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show's hospital setting. It's been, by turns, a good [[Soap opera|soap]], a good [[List of romantic comedy television series|romantic comedy]], a good [[medical drama]], and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/02/28/greys-anatomy-season-10 | work=Entertainment Weekly | first=Samantha | last=Highfill | title='Grey's Anatomy': What season 10 could learn from season 2 | date=February 28, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622112501/http://www.ew.com/article/2014/02/28/greys-anatomy-season-10 | archivedate=June 22, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryce Olin of ''[[Netflix]]'' ranked Grey's 9th among the ''50 Best TV Shows on Netflix'' stating, "It's a tough call, but based on Grey's casting choices and revolutionary portrayals of female doctors in the series, I'm willing to argue that Grey's Anatomy is the best medical drama of all time. Obviously, [[Shonda Rhimes]] didn't reinvent the wheel with the series, but there's no denying its popularity." adding, "I understand its significance in the pop culture sphere." He also stated that the show could go higher in the ranks with the upcoming season stating, "Apparently, Grey's Anatomy fans are passionate about their show, although it seems like they've been closeted for the last few years. I'd love to move Grey's Anatomy even higher on the ranking, but I'll have wait until the 11th season comes to Netflix."&lt;ref&gt;[http://netflixlife.com/tvshows/43/ 50 Best TV Shows on Netflix Right Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222080200/http://netflixlife.com/tvshows/43/ |date=December 22, 2015 }}.

Grey's has also been credited to helping redefine "good" television; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' writes, "Since ''[[The Sopranos]]'' burst onto the scene, we've too often classified a show as "good" based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It's time for that to end. At its best, Grey's has been among the very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it's been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of.

===U.S. television ratings===
''Grey{{'}}s Anatomy'' has received high viewership and ratings since its debut. The first four seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers, reaching its peak [[Nielsen ratings]] in the second season, attracting an average of 19.44 million viewers per episode, and ranking at fifth place overall. Following the show's time-slot being relocated, overall rankings steadily declined, dropping below the top ten in its fifth season. ''Grey's Anatomy'' made its greatest fall from its sixth to seventh season, slipping from seventeenth place to thirty-first. The series is on a steady decline in terms of overall viewership and rankings, yet ''Grey's Anatomy'' still holds value in charts when numbers are pulled from the [[digital video recorder]] (DVR). It was the most recorded show between 2007 and 2011, based on cumulative totals, and has been for several years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.co/ref&gt;m/2011/09/01/top-10-most-tivoed-shows/|title=The most Tivo'ed show on TV is ...|accessdate=September 2, 2011|date=September 1, 2011|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time, Inc|last=Rice|first=Lynette}}{{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grey's Anatomy'' had five crossover storylines with ''Private Practice''.
* "In Which We Meet Addison, a Nice Girl From Somewhere Else", the series premiere, starts with Addison and Richard talking about her resignation at Seattle Grace Hospital.
* "Before and After"/"Ex-Life"/"An Honest Mistake"&amp;nbsp;— Addison's brother Archer is brought to Seattle Grace for surgery, after which Derek asks for help with a pregnant neuro patient.
* "Invasion"/"Right Here, Right Now"&amp;nbsp;— After Izzie makes a mistake, causing the patient to lose out on a kidney transplant, Bailey travels to Los Angeles with her patient for the transplant.
* "Blink"/"Another Second Chance"&amp;nbsp;— Addison helps Mark perform an operation on his pregnant daughter.
* "Have You Seen Me Lately?"/"You Break My Heart"&amp;nbsp;— Derek's sister Amelia asks him to perform a risky gliosarcoma surgery on Erica Warner, the mother of Cooper's son Mason.
There have also been several instances where Addison or Amelia travel to Seattle without there being a storyline involving both shows.
After [[Private Practice]] ended, Amelia Sheppard appeared even more frequently on [[Grey's Anatomy]]. She was later cast as a series regular.
